    "text": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be effectively used for genome editing in human cells. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins function as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for genome editing applications, enabling precise modifications of DNA sequences. The system consists of a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence, where it induces a double-strand break. This break can be repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), allowing for gene knockout or precise gene editing, respectively. In this study, we optimized CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing protocols for human cells and demonstrated high efficiency editing of multiple target genes. We observed that the efficiency of editing varied depending on the cell type, target sequence, and delivery method. Future work will focus on improving the specificity of Cas9 to reduce off-target effects and developing methods for efficient delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in vivo for therapeutic applications.",
